# CLI::Console


Basic library for making interactive command-line applications much easier.


## Features

* Easy way to add commands and help info to them so it can be shown to user.
* Auto-completion for commands.
* Command aliasing.


## Installation

Simply

### Dependecies

This library doesn't have any dependencies.
Well actually there's no direct dependencies.
But in reality you do need HighLine.
Then why I said there's no dependencies?
Because `CLI::Console` will accept any IO class with implements those few functions which currently are provided by HighLine.
Also, this program requires ruby version 1.9.x

## Documentation

YARD with markdown is used for documentation (`redcarpet` required)
